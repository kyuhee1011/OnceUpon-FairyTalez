Looking at characters in Disney Movie

Description
This website allows users to look up characters from Disney movies. Users can look up a character by pressing a button either by character type or searching the movie title in the search bar to see the characters in the movie.

Features
When users open the page for the first time, all of the characters in database will appear. Users can look up characters by type using the character type buttons. If you click the prince button, the characters who are princes in the movie will appear. Also, if you click the princess button, princesses from the disney film will appear. If you press the other button, the characters with different roles in the disney film will appear. In addition, the buttons, letters, and image borders have the same color for each type. So that when the "all" button is clicked, the user can distinguish them by looking at the font colors and image borders

Another feature is that when you search for a movie title in the search window, movies related to the word are searched, and only characters related to the film will appear.
